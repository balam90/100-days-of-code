### Day 7: January 14 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finalized the shapes of my cub for the Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts**: Illustrating with CSS can be frustrating when you can't get elements to look just the way you want them to. I saw some illustrations done by others and was impressed by what can be done with SCSS.

### Day 6: January 13 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I adjusted positioning some more on my portfolio web page. I started working on my first Daily CSS Image challenge: a cub.

**Thoughts**: I really like the illustrations people have made with pure CSS code. I'm doing this challege to further improve my CSS skills. Don't know if it's something I'll incorporate all the time, but the practice is helping me grasp CSS.

### Day 5: January 10 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I adjusted the positioning of various elements in my Portfolio and Contact sections of my portfolio web page. I also added links to my social media accounts to the Contact section.

**Thoughts**: I used to be really confused by the box model when I first started out. I couldn't wrap my head around the concept. Now I rely on it to position everything the way I want it.

### Day 3: January 8, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I fixed up the styling of my headshot make it look better.

**Thoughts**: I had to crop the original image because it was too tall. I wanted a nice round image so I needed a square image to get the border-radius property to work the way I wanted it to. Honestly, I could've made more progress.

### Day 2: January 7 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on building the thumbnail grid for the Portfolio section of my Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage project for FreeCodeCamp. I also added my headshot and some placeholder text to the About section.

**Thoughts**: I didn't have too much difficulty today. I got a little stuck at first because I wasn't sure how to go about building the thumbnail grid. I don't have too many projects to showcase so I decided to just stack the thumbnails on top of one another. I had to look at Bootstrap's documentation to figure it all out, but once I looked it over, I got the idea right away.

### Day 1: January 6 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the hero image of my Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage project for FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: It took a bit of googling to figure out how to get my hero image to fill the screen. I mostly had trouble getting the height right. I eventually learned the special trick of using vh units to scale the image correctly. I'm pleased with the result for now. Simple stuff like this makes me feel like such a noob. Nonetheless, I'm excited about learning further and honing my craft.
