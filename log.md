# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: January 7 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on building the thumbnail grid for the Portfolio section of my Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage project for FreeCodeCamp. I also added my headshot and some placeholder text to the About section.

**Thoughts**: I didn't have too much difficulty today. I got a little stuck at first because I wasn't sure how to go about building the thumbnail grid. I don't have too many projects to showcase so I decided to just stack the thumbnails on top of one another. I had to look at Bootstrap's documentation to figure it all out, but once I looked it over, I got the idea right away.

### Day 1: January 6 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the hero image of my Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage project for FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: It took a bit of googling to figure out how to get my hero image to fill the screen. I mostly had trouble getting the height right. I eventually learned the special trick of using vh units to scale the image correctly. I'm pleased with the result for now. Simple stuff like this makes me feel like such a noob. Nonetheless, I'm excited about learning further and honing my craft.
