# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 6 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on the hero image of my Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage project for FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: It took a bit of googling to figure out how to get my hero image to fill the screen. I mostly had trouble getting the height right. I eventually learned the special trick of using vh units to scale the image correctly. I'm pleased with the result for now. Simple stuff like this makes me feel like such a noob. Nonetheless, I'm excited about learning further and honing my craft.
